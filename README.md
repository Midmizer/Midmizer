- 👋 Hi, I’m @Midmizer
- 👀 I’m interested in creating in general - I like making "stuff" but currently, programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CompSci as a university student. I got indoctrinated by my parents both working in IT and an unhealthy obession with deconstructing video games
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not much [I'd most likely be a hinderance at my current stage] but hit me up
- 📫 How to reach me: The site you're using to read this [hopefully]
